Hello World! My name is Matthew Pine, I am currently working as an AmeriCorps VISTA Member to bridge the digital divide in the city of Houston and the Greater Houston area. I am passionate about the Earth Sciences, enviromental justice, health literacy, adult education, and how these topics intersect with each other. On the side I like to write and develop software programs, in addition to develop scientific equipment for Geologists, and other researchers. For fun I love listening to music and watching video essays.
